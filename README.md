A collection of projects completed during my Informatics studies at Universitas Gunadarma.  
Includes work in software development, databases, networking, and web programming.

### Highlights:

- **Network Simulation** – Configured IP addressing, DNS, and SMTP using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
- **Data Analysis Project (Python)** – Explored and visualized datasets using Pandas and Matplotlib.
